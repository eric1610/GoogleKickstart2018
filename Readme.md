## Details
~~I managed to successfully solve at least 1 question for each of the rounds within the alloted time limit of 3 hours.~~

The majority of the solutions to the Google Kickstart 2018 problems were completed after the contest has ended.
The purpose is to practice my programming abilities and develop my knowledge of algorithms and data structures.

Also I still have a lot of fun being able to solve these problems! :grinning:

## Running the Code
To compile the .java solutions, please do the following:

Run the command: 
> javac Solution.java
Where Solution.java is the corresponding java file that contains the solution.

Then run the command:
> java Solution < input.in > output.out
Where input.in is the desired input file, and output.out will receive the output.

For the python solution, please do the following:
> py Solution.py < input.in > output.out
Where Solution.py (or q1.py, q2.py, etc.) is the corresponding python file that contaisn the solution, input.in is the desired input file and output.out will receive the output.
